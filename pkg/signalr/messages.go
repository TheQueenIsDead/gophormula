//Completion	Callee, Caller	Indicates a previous Invocation or StreamInvocation has completed or a stream in an Invocation or StreamInvocation has completed. Contains an error if the invocation concluded with an error or the result of a non-streaming method invocation. The result will be absent for void methods.

//CancelInvocation	Caller	Sent by the client to cancel a streaming invocation on the server.
//Ping	Caller, Callee	Sent by either party to check if the connection is active.
